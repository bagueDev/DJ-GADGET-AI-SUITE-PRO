🚀 Major Update: DJ Gadget AI Suite Pro v.3.0.0
"The Arrangement Update"
🌑 v.3.1.0 - THE ARCHITECT UPDATE (Top Secret Logic Injection)
We’ve been silent for a while because the code was screaming. Today, the Melody Lab evolves from a generator into a digital architect.
The core engine of the Melody Lab has been completely rewritten. We aren't just talking about a few new notes—we’ve implemented 
a deep-level musical brain that understands structure, energy, and harmonic tension on a level that shouldn't be possible in a local environment.
🧠 The New "Shadow" Logic
Under the hood, we’ve injected thousands of lines of complex algorithmic intelligence. 
This isn't a "black box" that guesses; it’s a high-precision machine that calculates every micro-tick.
Absolute Grid Precision: We’ve moved to a hard-grid timing system. No drift. No lag. Just pure, mathematical tightness that rivals professional studio hardware.
🎼 The 6-Layer Architecture (Unlocked)
We’ve expanded the horizon. The export engine now handles a full 6-track synchronized environment.
🔊 Studio-Grade Audio Overhaul
The internal preview engine has been "mastered."
•	Phase-Correct Synthesis: We've eliminated the digital artifacts. The sound is now 100% clean, even with complex, overlapping textures.
•	The Master Chain: We added a hidden "Mastering" layer. Stereo-width, soft-clipping, and a custom-built 3-layer synthesis model that brings a warm, "expensive" analog feel to your previews.
